## Regex Components



### Anchors

Anchors are used to match specific positions in a string. The most common anchors are the caret (^), which matches the start of a string, and the dollar sign ($), which matches the end of a string.



### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify the number of times a character or group should be matched. For example, the asterisk (*) indicates zero or more occurrences, the plus sign (+) indicates one or more occurrences, and the question mark (?) indicates zero or one occurrence.



### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs allow you to group multiple characters or patterns together and treat them as a single unit. Parentheses () are used to define groups. This allows you to apply quantifiers and other operators to the entire group.



### Bracket Expressions

 Bracket expressions, also known as character classes, allow you to define a set of characters to be matched. For example, [a-z] matches any lowercase letter, [0-9] matches any digit, and [aeiou] matches any vowel.



### Character Classes

Character classes are similar to bracket expressions but provide shorthand notations for common character sets. For example, \d matches any digit, \w matches any word character (letter, digit, or underscore), and \s matches any whitespace character. You can also use capital letters for other specifications.



### The OR Operator

The OR operator (|) allows you to specify multiple alternative patterns. It matches either the pattern on its left or the pattern on its right.



### Flags

 Flags are used to modify the behavior of a regex pattern. Common flags include "g" (global), which allows multiple matches, and "i" (case-insensitive), which ignores case when matching.


### Character Escapes

Character escapes are used to match special characters or represent characters that have special meanings in regex. For example, . matches a literal dot character, ^ matches a literal caret character, and \s matches a whitespace character.
